This is the summary of my study of COMP90048 Declarative Programming (SM2 2017).
Some material below is from the lecture notes &copy; the University of Melbourne.

## Some concepts

`Haskell` is a **functional programming language**.

`Functions` are the basic building blocks from which programs are constructed.
The **basic operation** in a functional languages is **function application**.

`ghc` is a Haskell compiler (the Glasgow Haskell Compiler).

`ghci` is an interactive programming environment for Haskell. Within it you can create, modify and run programs.
