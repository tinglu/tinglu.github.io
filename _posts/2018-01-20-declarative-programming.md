A very little notes of my study of COMP90048 Declarative Programming (SM2 2017).
The notes below contain my summaries and lecture materials (&copy; the University of Melbourne).

## Some concepts

`Haskell` is a **functional programming language**.

`Functions` are the basic building blocks from which programs are constructed.
The **basic operation** in a functional languages is **function application**.

`ghc` is a Haskell compiler (the Glasgow Haskell Compiler).

`ghci` is an interactive programming environment for Haskell. Within it you can create, modify and run programs.

## Haskell features

* lexical scoping
* higher-order functions
* pattern matching
* lazy functions and data constructors polymorphism
* strong static type inference user-defined data types
* principled overloading
* monadic I/O
* type-safe modules

No loop constructs—iteration is expressed as **recursion** or via higher-order functions.
