I'd like to study COMP30026 Models of Computation independently in my spare time.
Below are my notes. Some material included is from the lecture notes &copy; the University of Melbourne.

## Why's

### Why study logic and discrete maths

Logic and discrete mathematics provide the **theoretical foundations** for computer science.
`Propositional logic` has applications in hardware and software verification, planning, testing and fault finding, ...
`Predicate logic` is essential to artificial intelligence, computational linguistic, automated theorem proving, logic programming, ...
`Algebra` underpins theories of databases, programming languages, program analysis, data mining, ...

### Why study computability

Because it is important to have an understanding of the **limitations of algorithmic problem solving**.
It is important to know that there are simple functions that are **not computable**.
It is important to know that there are simple questions that are **not decidable**.
Computability is full of philosophically challenging ideas, and exciting (sometimes surprising) results.

## Topics

* Propositional and predicate logic;
* Sets, functions, and relations;
* Proof principles, induction and recursion, well-ordering;
* Regular languages, finite-state automata, context-free languages;
* Computability and decidability.

## Terminology

`axiomatization` - 公理化

`decidability` - 可判定性

`undecidability` - 不可判定性
