This is my study notes of [Fundamentals of Graphic Design](https://www.coursera.org/learn/fundamentals-of-graphic-design/) provided by Coursera.
The notes below contain my summaries and lecture materials.
All the images below are screenshots from the online videos &copy; CalArts.

## I. Fundamentals of Imagemaking

- Image
- Type
- Shape & Color
- Composition

### Denotation

> It is what it is!

### Imagemaking techniques

- Techniques
  - shape
  - color
  - volume
  - texture
  - weight
- Process, Generation, Iteration

### Connotation

> Not what it is!

An idea or feeling that a word invokes in addition to its literal meaning.

## II. Fundamentals of Typography

How we communicate with words.

### The Lexicon of Letters

#### The anatomy of letters:

A lot of typographic terms are based on the human body:

#### Words and Spacing

Alignment:

Spacing:
![Words spacing]({{ site.url }}/assets/design/graphic_design/words_spacing.png){:width="450"}


#### Type Size: The Point System

POINT SIZE - the measurement system for type.

**72 points = 1 inch => 1 inch = 1/72 point**

Basic standard type size:

#### Typesetting Text - Leading (行距)

Height btw baselines

### How to Choose a Typeface

#### Typefaces, Fonts and Type Families

Font vs. Typeface:
![font]({{ site.url }}/assets/design/graphic_design/font.png){:width="400"}
![typeface]({{ site.url }}/assets/design/graphic_design/typeface.png){:width="400"}

Serif vs. Sans Serif:
![serif]({{ site.url }}/assets/design/graphic_design/serif.png){:width="200"}

#### Typeface Categories

Serif:
![typeface_category_serif]({{ site.url }}/assets/design/graphic_design/typeface_category_serif.png){:width="500"}

Sans Serif:
![typeface_category_sans_serif]({{ site.url }}/assets/design/graphic_design/typeface_category_sans_serif.png){:width="500"}

Weight & Width:

### How to "Read" Typography

#### Denotation vs. Connotation in Type

### How to Use a Typeface

#### Letterforms (字体)

#### Experimenting with Leterforms

#### Typographic Composition


## III. Fundamentals of Shape and Color

Topics:
- Simple & Complex Forms
- Negative & Position Space
- Figure/Ground Relationships
- Attributes of Color
- Complimentary vs. Contrasting
- Print vs. Screen
- Repetition, Rhythm, Pattern

#### Graphic Shapes

Graphic shapes are used to make marks, icons, symbols.

#### Visual Contrast

- simple geometry shapes vs. non-geometrical shapes with contrast
- small vs. large
- vertical vs. horizontal
- narrow vs. broad/wide
- (depth) shallow vs. deep
- moving vs. static
- (tone) light vs. dark
- soft vs. hard
- (weight) light vs. heavy
- line vs. volume

#### Marks, Icons, and Symbols

Marks = graphic shapes = normally no connotation => denotative form

Icons:
- pictorial
- represents actual things
- easy to read

Symbols:
- non-pictorial
- represents ideas/products
- learned/coded

#### Negative/Positive, Figure/Ground

An object on a background relationship that results in different perceptions.

Figure/Ground relationship examples:
- black shape on white background is brighter than white shape on black background
- different figures with different depth produce the different distance on same ground
- figures in same size but different tones produce different depth (darker denser shapes are closer than those lighter fuzzier ones)

#### Working with Color
#### The Color Wheel
#### Mixing Color: Paint, Print and Screen

### Rhythm and Pattern

## IV. Fundamentals of Composition

### All About Contrast

#### Visual Contrasts
#### Single Contrasts
#### Multiple Contrasts
#### Type Contrasts
#### Image Contrasts


### Working with Images

#### Composition in a Single Image
#### Cropping and Hierarchy

### Putting It All Together
#### Composition in Context
